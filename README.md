# Installer
A simple installer of the program.
Many probably know that it is possible to convert .py files to .exe, but what if the project includes not only modules and python files used. I came up with an idea how to solve all this. I will make an Installer that will upload your project to the computer with the files you need.


# How does it work?

All your files need to be compressed into a ZIP file, then this file is copied and embedded in Python code. When you run the program, a ZIP file is created on your PC and extracted with your files.
